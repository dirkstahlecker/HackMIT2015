#HACKMIT 2015 Presentation Notes

##Overview
- Search and identify location by photo
- Get lowest fee travel information and itineraries

##API
- Clarifai
- Amadeus

##Value
- People see pictures on Intagram / Reddit etc. of cool places to go, but don't know where they are
- Identify location AND find the cheapest option
- No such tool exists that connect the two

##Demo
- Notes that speed was somewhat bottle necked by the APIs we were using
-

##Future
- Self sustaining (users teach the learning algorithm)
- Build the database using the deep learning platform custom training
- Work with companies with API to optimise queries for more optimal

##Biggest Challenges
- Coming up with an idea that was interesting and useful
- Using the existing APIs to make that happing
- Working with alpha-tested APIs
